# Reflection

Milestone 3 provided me a holistic view of SE development workflow. I have gained a better understanding of how the theory aspect that we have learnt at the start of the project translated into the actual project development. Throughout this 3rd phase of the project, I can see how the entire project develops from just plans on paper to actual product. Along the way, the team has added/removed features and how it interacts with the bigger picture.

Each of my teammates contributed to the whole process by crafting the diagrams for us to follow and adhere to. This gave us a clearer picture of what needs to be done and the timeline which we must work with. 

The tri-weekly mini meetings that we had helped us understand the working styles of our teammates and helped us keep up to date with the progress along the way. Feedback from M2 was crucial in helping us narrow down what needs to be improved on.

My main contributions were to the website template and also the gameplay portion of the project. I implemented the blockly code that will control both the website visuals and the car via functions that were given to me by my SE teammates. I also ensured that the gameplay is in line with what is planned beforehand. 

Overall, the team felt that there were more that we could have done but we have tried our best and learnt a great deal throughout this process.
