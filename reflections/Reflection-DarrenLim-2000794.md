# Personal Reflection

The entire process of developing a website based on what was being documented in previous milestones were eye-opening. It made everything so much clearer when the documents were properly done up and it was amazing to see how everything links up together. Through this project, I had learnt how to better organize my code using design pattern, in my case â€“ MVC Design Pattern, as well as how can we convert the designed diagrams in the document to programming code. I had also learnt on the proper usage of GitHub and realised the mistakes that I had always made before learning the proper way of using them, such as working together at a single branch and even when not working in the same branch, will always approve my own pull request to main branch. I had also realised the importance of doing Whitebox testing, to ensure that both the code and output are correct. In conclusion, this module has taught me on the importance of Software Engineering and provided me the steppingstone to cultivate a good practice when working on a project. It was also a good experience to be working with peers from different specialisation to come out with a single project, which also in a way build up our understanding with each other on our different hectic schedules.
