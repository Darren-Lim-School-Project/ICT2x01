# Personal Reflection

---------------------------------------------
At the end of Milestone 3, I learned the importance of proper planning and time management. Considering the limited timeframe that we had due to our other modules, being able to complete Milestone 3 was a huge achievement for me. 

In Milestone 2, I had several issues trying to come up with the class diagrams and ensuring that the functions and classes created would actually work during implementation. However, it turned out that the classes were wrong and the team had to rework the whole web application system. Instead of going for layered architecture, the team decided to go with MVC for milestone 3. This was a huge change in our planning and required several days and weeks for us to complete our planning again. However, despite the detour, the team managed to come up with a robust web application that uses Object-Oriented programming and follows the MVC architecture. 

Personally, I felt that I had contributed a lot to the web application. I was in charge of the User Management component consisting of Admin Login feature, Whitelisting of car feature, and Sessions management. Thankfully with previous experiences in 1004, I was able to complete my parts. Additionally, I also implemented extra security features such as secured session management, string sanitization, input validation, and password hashes. The experience gained has taught me to persevere and implement good software architectures, designs, and security practices in order to meet client requirements while having a robust and secure product.

I was also tasked with doing the Whitebox Testing Section of Milestone 3. It was interesting to apply what I have learned during the lectures and lessons by Prof Chek. During the test suite run, the class being tested ran into several issues that required a lot of refactoring. It took quite a while to fix the class functions to ensure that it would behave according to its intended behavior. This experience showed me how useful testing really is to ensure limited bugs in our application.

All in all, despite enjoying coding the web application and running tests, I am glad that Milestone 3 and the module have come to an end.
