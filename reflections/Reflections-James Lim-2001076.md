# Personal Reflection
## James Lim 2001076 (P4-9)
---------------------------------------------
From M3 I understood the importance of setting realistic goals and expectations.
Things set out from M1 and M2 may not always work out fine in the end, and it’s up to one’s adaptability to solve the issue.
I also understood the vast differences in OOP style coding and procedural coding style.
Things like Whitebox testing and Blackbox testing are also vital in making sure the program works as stated. Only with rigorous testing can the team decide whether the program is up to standard without bugs or faults. M3 also made me realised the difficulty of time management when given a part to work on at a very tight time.
