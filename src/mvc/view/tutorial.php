                            <h3>What is IR-Acer?</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p>With the rise of the digital age, people are more connected than they ever have been. Children as young as primary school students are able to use social media and internet services through their personal smartphones. Schools are also looking towards using smart-devices to help cultivate their learning.
                                To further support schools in their efforts, this project aims to instill logical thinking and problem-solving skills amongst the younger generation by creating a fun and interactive toy that these children can use.
                                IR-Acer is a three-wheel robot-car that is made for children above the age of 5-6 to get involved in the world of programmable robots. IR-Acer will exercise their logical and problem-solving skills in a fun and creative manner by demonstrating how instructions (code blocks) can interact with the robot car.
                                Children can set up obstacles and learn how to program a route, which will allow them to visualise the path needed for the robot to traverse and reach its end goal. IR-Acer will allow children to nurture their problem-solving skills and get instant feedback on whether their pre-programmed routes work or not.
                                Controlling IR-Acerâ€™s movement can be done in real time or can be pre-programmed through the web UI. The web UI will also be able to display robot system information.</p>
